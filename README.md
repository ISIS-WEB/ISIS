🌍 ZeroWaste - Ensuring Food Safety Through Smart Redistribution
ZeroWaste is a community-driven platform aimed at reducing food wastage and ensuring food safety by connecting donors (such as restaurants, events, individuals, etc.) with receivers (NGOs, shelters, and people in need) in real-time. Our mission is to make food rescue efficient, safe, and accessible using smart geolocation-based matching and logistics coordination.

🚀 Key Features
🔁 Real-Time Food Matching: Automatically connects food donors with nearby receivers based on location and food requirements.

📍 Geolocation Tracking: Ensures efficient and timely pickup/delivery of food using map-based routing.

🔒 Food Safety Protocols: Incorporates basic food safety checks and handling guidelines to ensure quality.

📦 Donation Management: Track, schedule, and manage food donations seamlessly through an intuitive interface.

📊 Analytics Dashboard (planned): View donation statistics, impact tracking, and reduce carbon footprint.

🌱 Our Goal
To create a sustainable, tech-driven solution that addresses food insecurity and food waste, contributing to Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12).
